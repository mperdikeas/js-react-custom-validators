Since I am bringing in the lodash definitions
using flow-typed in the normative directory [flow-typed], I
no longer use these definitions.

I just keep them around for
reference and in case I need to add my own in the "decls"
dir that's configured in the the [lib] property in file
[.flowconfig]

Note that according to this answer:

... the definitions in the [lib]-configured directory are
used *in addition* to those found in [flow-typed].
